# Scotts-Box
 A collection of unity scripts and assets that can be used between projects

Changes Made in Honours Project

In SphereCast Interactor And LookInteract Trigger added code so that sphere cast interactor can trigger the look interact trigger.
Comment out the code becuse it was not need and untested
